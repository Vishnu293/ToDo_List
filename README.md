# To Do List Webpage using React JS

This is a simple To Do List webpage designed using React JS,
Here in this I prepared my own Javascript code with JSX and styled with CSS with my own knownledge.
(Actually this is my first and simple project in React JS and looking forward to do more projects and I do upload here...)

If you want to have this code on your system do this now, Make sure u have installed React JS and a code editor (VS Code Recommended) your local system.
If not open this link https://nodejs.org/en/download for React JS and https://code.visualstudio.com/download for VS code.
Steps to follow, 👇
1. Download the code as ZIP file ⬇️
2. Extract the file and save in your folder 👾
3. Open the folder in your Editor (I used VS Code) 😇
4. Open App.js file and run the code in your editor to view this To Do List project prepared by me. 

Happy Coding ! 🤞
